**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because both can be used to improve user experience as with graceful degradation, the number of advanced features become inaccessible at lower levels/older systems but the core functionalities of an application like data access and viewing the page are still accessible. Similarly, service workers improve user experience as they make the app accessible even when its offline using cache data. Moreover, service workers also allow for faster loading times hence improving performance as well. Hence, both help improve user focused -ilities.
